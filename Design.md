# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Team Attendance Tracker**

Project Author: **Coen Williams**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

An issue that I have with coaching and other coaches that I am around have experienced is the uncertainty of the number of players that will be attending activity's such as:
- Training
- Games
- Events

### End-User Requirements

This webpage will be solely used by myself, management of the team I coach and most of all players are they are the ones liable for letting me know whether they will be available for upcoming activity's.

### Proposed Solution

I intend to create a web app that will aim to allow coaching staff to know who will be attending what activity or wont be by also giving reasoning. 


-------------------------------------------------
## Relevant Implications

### Functionality

This implication means how effective is the state of the app, website or database. Does it do what the client asks of it? Do people know how to use it?

This implication will be relevant to this web app as it ensures that the user will be able to understand their way around the web app and how to use it. This is important as I don't want users to be confused as this should be an easy web app to navigate.

I will need to consider the needs of my users and how they would like this web app to function therefore allowing them to be comfortable with the format. This will allow the user to understand where everything is on the web app and what it asks of them. I will also have to create an effective database with relevant tables to be able to keep data of the users that is appropriate to the web app.

### Usability

The Usability relevant implication ensures that the webapp has user freedom, flexibility, potentially a real world match and error prevention or being able to recover from errors.

This implication is vital to my webapp it will be heavily used by my primary users who will have to constantly be using it to confirm attendance therefore things like error prevention and user freedom is key.

To make this implication relevant to my webapp i need to consider the users point of view and need for the webapp by talking to my them so they are comfortable with understanding where to go on the webapp, and whether errors are causing big issues and aren't resolving them self.

### Privacy

Ensure that the users data is stored somewhere secure. And allows the user to access/change their information when wanting too.

This implication is relevant towards my webapp as my users need to be able to change their attendance only and not tamper with anyone elses attendance.

I will have to consider whether having a password for each end user is more efficient than a pin. To make this decision, I will have to have conversations with my end users on what they would prefer.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
