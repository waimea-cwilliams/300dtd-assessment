# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Team Attendance Tracker**

Project Author: **Coen Williams**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Junior A basketball players have different priorities outside of basketball. This can make it difficult for them to be able to make it to trainings, or games etc. Therefore the coach may not know who will be coming to what training/game. This can then effect the plan from the coach as they may have certain aspects of trainings or games that require a certain amount of people. 

### End-User Requirements

The junior boys in this situation are the players. These boys are always busy with school and other sports outside of basketball. These users will want the system to be very straight forward and presentable to them so they are able to select their attendance for each session without trouble.

The coach/manager will be able to access all of the players accounts, allowing them to view the attendance. This means the system will have to be simple for them to use. 

### Proposed Solution

A webapp for the Waimea Junior A basketball team that allows the players to view each session that is upcoming and select whether they will be able to make it to said session or not which they are required to give reasoning for.

The website will also allow the manager and coach to view each players attendance and add future sessions to the webapp allowing the Juniors to be able to focus on each new session.

Players should be able to:
- Identify themselves (via pin) 
- Confirm attendance (with description)

Coaches/Managers should be able to:
- Add future sessions
- View teams attendance

## Relevant Implications

### Functionality

This implication means how effective is the state of the app, website or database. Does it do what the client asks of it? Do people know how to use it?

This implication will be relevant to this web app as it ensures that the user will be able to understand their way around the web app and how to use it. This is important as I don't want users to be confused as this should be an easy web app to navigate.

I will need to consider the needs of my users and how they would like this web app to function therefore allowing them to be comfortable with the format. This will allow the user to understand where everything is on the web app and what it asks of them. I will also have to create an effective database with relevant tables to be able to keep data of the users that is appropriate to the web app.

### Usability

The Usability relevant implication ensures that the webapp has user freedom, flexibility, potentially a real world match and error prevention or being able to recover from errors.

This implication is vital to my webapp it will be heavily used by my primary users who will have to constantly be using it to confirm attendance therefore things like error prevention and user freedom is key.

To make this implication relevant to my webapp i need to consider the users point of view and need for the webapp by talking to my them so they are comfortable with understanding where to go on the webapp, and whether errors are causing big issues and aren't resolving them self.

-------------------------------------------------
## Relevant User Experience (UX) Principles

### Accessibility

Ensuring that a product or a service is accessible to and usable for as many people as possible. Also, understanding how different environments and situational factors might impact the user experience.

This is relevant to my project as my web app needs to be able to reach out to everyone involved with my Junior team this year otherwise I wont be able to hear from everyone about their attendance. It also needs to understand different time situations like what trainings and games are available for them to say they are present or not for.

I will need to consider what is easier for my users for them to be able to get access to this webapp by talking to them about what device they are using. Also try and create a calendar feature on the web app that lets the players say present or not for about 2-3 weeks in the future.

### Consistency

Consistency is creating products that solve specific user problems. This keeps the design consistent on how they look and how the design functions across all screens.

This UX principle is relevant towards my project as my web app needs to consistently functional across multiple different screens and devices as most of the people using this web app will be using mobile phones, whilst I will be using it through a laptop to see who has used it.

I will need to consider the design of the webpage so it therefore allows the user to use different devices while the design stays consistent. To do this, I will need to console with my users to be able to understand a view that works for them.

### User-Freedom

User Freedom allows users that makes mistakes, which happens often, exit or go back therefore allowing them to undo their last action so they can go back to the systems previous state.

This UX principle is very useful towards my web app as my users will need to be able to undo a action if they were to accidentally click the wrong button or if they wanted to change what they had selected for their attendance as maybe something came up.

I will need to add a undo feature to this project therefore allowing the user to see the previous state of the webapp.

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *final design* of your database: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place images here that show your *final design* of your UI: layout, colours, etc.


-------------------------------------------------

## Completed System

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *actual database structure* that you implemented: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place screenshots and notes here that show your *actual system UI* in action.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
