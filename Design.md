Project Name: **Team Attendance Tracker**

Project Author: **Coen Williams**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

An issue that I have with coaching and other coaches that I am around have experienced is the uncertainty of the number of players that will be attending activity's such as:
- Training
- Games
- Events

### End-User Requirements

This webpage will be solely used by myself, management of the team I coach and most of all players are they are the ones liable for letting me know whether they will be available for upcoming activity's.

### Proposed Solution

I intend to create a web app that will aim to allow coaching staff to know who will be attending what activity or wont be by also giving reasoning.
